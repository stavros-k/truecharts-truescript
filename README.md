### Examples
#### bash heavy_script.sh -b 14 -i portainer -i arch -i sonarr -i radarr -t 600 -sup
- This is your typical cron job implementation. 
- -b is set to 14. Up to 14 snapshots of your ix-applications dataset will be saved
- -i is set to ignore portainer, arch, sonarr, and radarr. These applications will be ignored when it comes to updates.
- -t I set it to 600 seconds, this means the script will wait 600 seconds for the application to become ACTIVE before timing out and continuing to a different application. 
- -s will just sync the repositories, ensuring you are downloading the latest updates
- -u update applications as long as the major version has absolutely no change, if it does have a change it will ask the user to update manually.
- -p Prune docker images.
